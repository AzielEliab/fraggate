Software Catalog and Lattice Ledger
AZL-VOL-1.0 · runtime 1.6.13 · registry 3de5ed2e23ae9a76 · 2026-09-06 · Aziel Eliab

Volume of each named software on the public FragGate door, plus the hash-chained temporal question × act record an agent
is allowed to read. Not a kit. Not a new FragGate slug. Clock is not Lock. Mesh default OFF.

    AI reads the lattice by citing record hashes. It does not remember answers. Encryption, when used, is a
    local envelope whose hash enters the chain. The chain itself is not a ciphertext.

1. How an AI reads this lattice
Attach at POST /mcp or POST /v1/fraggate/call. Pipeline: fraggate_list → fraggate_describe → fraggate_call. Every call that
matters writes an AZL-LEDGER record whose payload is the question or act bytes, slug, op, and engine digest. The model
sentence is render only.

  • Cite record.hash + kind + question + payload_sha256. That is recollection.
  • If ZionPattern is missing, cite triad and say solver not run. Do not invent a blended percent.
  • If the door refuses, cite the refuse record. Do not retry under a new name.
  • Do not put passwords, token bodies, cookies, or model sentences in payload.
  • To verify: python3 azl-ledger/reader.py verify acts.jsonl then export-ai.
  • Catalog file for agents: azl-ledger/catalog.json (live slugs, ops, stubs as of 1.6.13).


2. Hash chain versus encryption
Two different machines. People collapse them into one sentence.

  Layer                                  What it does                                              What it does not do

  Hash chain (this ledger +              Proves order and integrity of questions and acts.         Does not hide bytes. Public records are readable.
  TemporalLock)                          Anyone can verify SHA-256 over canonical JSON.

  Local envelope (ARK / OS               Encrypts secrets on the operator disk. Ledger stores      Hosted Workers do not unlock vaults. Public door
  keychain)                              envelope_sha256 only.                                     stubs unlock / encrypt / scorch.

  EmbryoLock                             Local-not-hosted destructive vault. Name on the           Not a FragGate engine. Not a hosted Worker.
                                         software tab.

  Publish gate                           Official API token in env/keychain +                      Not encryption. Not browser login.
                                         AZBOT_PUBLISH=1.




3. Exec pipe
    open → DecisionGATE → fraggate_call(slug, op, payload) → timeslate(question|act) → render
    (disposable) → close

  Measure                                     N                 Note

  Live software-tab                           33                Hosted card exists.

  FragGate live slugs                         33                Allowlist on the door.

  FragGate stub ops                           124               Named refuse. Not silent 404.

  Local-only count                            1                 Full node / vault stays local.

  FG product_count                            35                live + local_only + stub must still sum.


Separate software / sibling software under one FragGate door. Never separate FragGate engines. Clock is not Lock. Sort law:
plain A–Z → gate A–Z → lock A–Z (Clock ≠ Lock).


5. How to call any live slug
POST          /v1/fraggate/call        with        header        User-Agent:  Mozilla/5.0    and      JSON
{"slug":"temporallock","op":"verify","payload":{...}}. Unknown slug → FG-HALLUC-TOOL. Stub op → named refuse
receipt. Mesh enable is operator bearer only; GET /v1/mesh never enables.

8. AZL-LEDGER-1.0 record
Canonical JSON, sort_keys true, separators comma-colon. hash = SHA-256 of {prev, kind, profile, question, payload, utc}.
Genesis prev is 64 zeros. File format is JSONL, one record per line. Schema: azl-ledger/schema.json. Reader:
azl-ledger/reader.py. Example chain: azl-ledger/acts.example.jsonl.

  Field                        Rule

  prev / hash                  64 hex. hash covers prev + body. Break either and verify fails.

  kind                         genesis | question | act | ask | call | queue | hold | refuse | verify | seal

  profile                      operator | shelf | runtime | publisher | coder | or local slug

  question                     The typed question or the act verb. Never the model reply.

  payload                      slug, op, input, verdict, why, http, text_sha256, envelope_sha256, engine_digest, token_present. No password, no token
                               body, no cookie, no model_sentence.

  utc                          YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ


TemporalLock remains the catalog engine (genesis / append / verify). AZL-LEDGER is the question × act specialization
written beside it so a model has a single cite rule. It is not a 36th software-tab product.
